The group part of the hand-in consists of the following exercises in CLRS for NP-completeness:

34.4-6, 34.5-1, 34.5-6, 34.5-7 (for 34.5-1, the definition of "isomorphic graphs" can be found in Appendix B).   Optional group exercise (not to be handed in): 34.4-7

And these exercises on exact exponential algorithms and parameterized complexity.

In addition to the group hand-in, each student in the group should write their own summary of "NP-completeness", and "Exact exponential algorithms and parameterized complexity" which are two of the topics at the exam.  The summary for NP-completeness should cover the full topic, even though you have already summarized part of it in Assignment 3.

See Assignment 1 for more details on how to structure the summary.
