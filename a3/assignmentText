The group part of the hand-in consists of the following exercises:

For the hashing part we use Mikkel Thorups hashing notes , in particular
Exercise 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (in (b), assume x is not in S), 2.5*, 2.6*, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3* (you must prove that the collision probability is at most c/m. It is not sufficient to prove cÂ²/m), 3.4* (Hint: The answer is no, because not all pairs of keys hash independently. Your job is to prove this.), 3.5, 3.6.
The ones marked * are the "hard" ones, and should be weighted more. Many of them require getting the right idea.

For NP-completeness, we use CLRS chapter 34-34.3, exercises 34.1-1, 34.1-5 (see remark below), 34.2-5, 34.2-6, 34.2-8, 34.3-2, and 34.3-3.

Remark for the second part of 34.1-5: the exercise text in the book does not make this clear but the number of distinct subroutines needs be constant, i.e., it is not allowed to depend on n, the size of the input.

In addition to the group hand-in, each student in the group should write their own summary of "Hashing", as well as their own summary of "NP-completeness" which are two of the topics at the exam. Note that there will be 2 lectures on NP-completeness, and the second lecture is the day before the deadline.   It is OK if your summary only covers the first of the NP-completeness lectures.

Submit the hand-in as a single pdf as described in the Assignment 1 text.

The rules for the re-handin are the same as for Assignment 1.
