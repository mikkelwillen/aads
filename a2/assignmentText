Exercises for Linear programming and optimization:

29.1-5, 29.2-6, 29.3-5 og 29.4-1 from CLRS

Exercises for Randomized Algorithms:

* For any given key x in S, let d(x) be the depth of x in the search tree generated by RandQS. Give a lower and an upper bound, as a function of the number of keys n, on the expected value of d(x) such that these bounds are within a constant factor from each other. That is, find a function f(n) and prove that E[d(x)]=Theta(f(n)).

* How many runs of randomized contraction do we need to be 99% sure that a minimum cut is found?

* In the pdf Download pdfon randomized algorithms, do exercises 1.2 and 1.3. (In 1.3 you may assume that T(n) is the worst case running time of A)


In addition to the group hand-in, each student in the group should write their own summary of "Linear programming and optimization" as well as their own summary of "Randomized Algorithms" which are two of the topics at the exam. See Assignment 1 for more details on how to structure these summaries.

Submit the hand-in as a single pdf as described in the Assignment 1 text.

The rules for the re-handin are the same as for Assignment 1.
